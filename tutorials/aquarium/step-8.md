# Hide Details

If you want, you can hide all development details and leave just the visualization, so to obtain a much cleaner and understandable _app_.

Disable **Edit ingredients** and **Show ingredient header bars** in the **Recipe panel** (top of this column).
Also click on the **Hide/show Operation panel** button.

If you want to also remove the tutorial content, **before hiding ingredient header bars**, click on the number inside the **Show ingredient header bars** and activate the **Slider** and **Markdown** ingredients.
In the _now visible_ header bars of the **Markdown** and **Slider** ingredients, disable the **Show ingredient details** option.

Alternatively, activate the visualization of all ingredients up to the **Restore** operation, and remove them from the recipe (they actually encode the tutorial content).
