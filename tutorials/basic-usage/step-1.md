> We want to **learn ASP**, and we want to do it **using ASP!**

## What the hell is this?!?

This is **ASP Chef**, a very recent product of mine aiming at bringing in our community the _amazing user experience_ of [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)&input=V1c5MUlHTmhibTV2ZENCeWRXNGdRVk5RSUdobGNtVWdPaWc9) that many cybersecurity learners and professionals are used to.


## Layout

The layout of ASP Chef is designed to ease the definition of pipelines using the [clingo-wasm](https://github.com/domoritz/clingo-wasm) ASP engine.
On the left you can see the **Operations panel**.
Type something in the filter field to restrict the shown operations.
Click on an operation to add it at the end of the recipe, which is shown here in the **Recipe panel**.
Input and output are provided and shown in the **I/O panel** on the right of the screen.


## Keybindings

You can jump to the filter field by releasing the focus (press `ESC`) and using the keybinding `F`.
After that, you may notice that some keybindings are shown on the first 11 operations;
the first operation is associated with `ENTER`, then there are `1`, `2` and so on, and finally there is `0`.

Similarly, you can jump to the input panel with the keybinding `I`.

Other keybindings are available for the commands associated with the buttons on the top of the Recipe panel:
- `H` to toggle the inline help;
- `O` to set options;
- `Arrow Left` to toggle the Operations panel;
- `Arrow Right` to toggle the I/O panel;
- `D` to toggle details of the recipe;
- `E` to toggle the editing of ingredients;
- `B` to toggle the visibility of ingredient header bars;
- `P` to toggle the automatic baking of the recipe;
- `S` to show the _safely load recipe_ form;
- `C` to copy the URL in the clipboard;
- `R` to reload the recipe.
