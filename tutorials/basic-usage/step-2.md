# Hello, ASP Chef!

Let's start with something simple.
Being thought for ASP, almost everything rounds around it.
The format of input and output is an **array of models**, where a model is an array of atoms.
(Sometimes the notion of model is relaxed to be an array of terms, but this is not important at the moment.)


## Input

Type the following in the input panel:
```asp
say("Hello").
ยง
say("ASP Chef").
```
You may notice that the output panel now shows the same content of the input.
You may also notice that both input and output contain two models, and this is clearly reported in the panels.
