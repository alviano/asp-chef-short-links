# Hello, ASP Chef!

## More Fun to Come!

You can add other ingredients to the recipe to obtain anything you like.
To keep it simple, let's try the **Input Union** operation.
Once it is added to the recipe, the output becomes the following:
```asp
say("Hello").
say("ASP Chef").
```

**There is much more you can do with ASP Chef!**
We will see more in the next lectures, as for example the powerful **Markdown** operation.
To get an idea, add a **Search Models** operation with the following content:
`````
__base64__("IyBJIHdhbm5hIHNpbXBseSBzYXkgInt7IAogICNzaG93IFggOiBzYXkoWCkuCiAgI3Nob3cgc2VwYXJhdG9yKCIsICIpCn19ISIKCkJ1dCBJIGNvdWxkIGFsc28gb2J0YWluIGEgdGFibGUgd2l0aCBjdXN0b20gb3JkZXJpbmc6Cnt7CiAgI3Nob3cgdGgoInNheS8xIikuCiAgI3Nob3cgdHIoWCkgOiBzYXkoWCkuCiAgI3Nob3cgc29ydCgxKS4KfX0=").
`````
After that, add the **Markdown** operation to obtain an HTML snippet with data coming from the models in input.

Don't be afraid if something is unclear at the moment.
We should have sufficient time to explore a bit more ASP Chef in the next days.
